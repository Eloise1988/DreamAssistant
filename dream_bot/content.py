DREAM_TYPES_GUIDE = (
    "Dream Types\n\n"
    "1) Ordinary: everyday scenes and logic.\n"
    "2) Lucid: you realize you are dreaming and can influence events.\n"
    "3) Nightmare: fear-heavy dreams often linked to stress processing.\n"
    "4) Daydream: drifting thought-style imagery.\n"
    "5) Vivid: high detail, color, sensory intensity.\n"
    "6) Recurring: repeating locations, themes, or conflicts.\n"
    "7) False Awakening: dream of waking up while still asleep.\n"
    "8) Prophetic-feeling: meaningful future-oriented symbolism."
)

RECALL_TIPS = (
    "Recall and Lucidity Tips\n\n"
    "1) Keep phone next to bed and log immediately on waking.\n"
    "2) Use a short title plus 3 symbols before full writing.\n"
    "3) Do 8-12 reality checks across the day.\n"
    "4) Before sleep repeat: 'Next time I dream, I know I'm dreaming.'\n"
    "5) Sleep 7.5-9h. Lucidity falls sharply with sleep debt.\n"
    "6) If awake after 5-6h sleep, do 15-25 min calm wake-back-to-bed.\n"
    "7) Re-read old entries weekly to detect recurring dream signs."
